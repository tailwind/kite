  A batteries included React Native boilerplate
</div>

## Why?
<!--- Explain why we made this project -->
We got a lot of value starting off from Infinite Red's [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) boilerplate, but bit by bit stripped pieces of it away, replacing them with patterns/tech we're familiar with here at Tailwind. To prevent duplicating work for future mobile endeavors, this is our approach to a batteries included react native boilerplate.
